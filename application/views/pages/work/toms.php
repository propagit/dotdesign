                            Designing for TOMS has been the most rewarding experience for Dot Design. A brand that stands for 'Giving' and that has the global recognition it deserves for doing great things in a greedy world is a rare client opportunity. Working with TOMS for many years, we've seen the brand reach out and gently tell their story of love and generosity throughout Australia. Reflecting this in our designs and product development is paramount. When we endorse a brand with our hearts, designing feels effortless and without question is very enjoyable.
